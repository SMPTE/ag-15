    <h2>Participation Agreement</h2>
    <p>The following participation agreement shall be signed by all guests at meetings of Technology Committees or their subgroups. Completed forms shall be sent to the Director of Engineering (<a href="mailto:standards@smpte.org">standards@smpte.org</a>).</p>

<pre>

Name of Committee(s): ______________________________________________

By submitting this application I understand:

  • That, subject to my agreement to the provisions of this Agreement, I will be permitted to 
    attend meetings of the above-mention committee;
  • That this Agreement does not entitle me to participate in other groups, or provide access
    to documents, email lists, etc. of the committee;
  • That full participation is available to SMPTE members, and to non-members, who pay the 
    corresponding annual participation fee;

I acknowledge and agree:

  • To be governed by <a href="#bib-smpte-bylaws"></a> (available at <a>https://www.smpte.org/about/policies-and-governance</a>)
  • That I will adhere to the provisions of the SMPTE Operations Manuals applicable to
    Engineering Committees (available at <a>https://www.smpte.org/about/policies-andgovernance</a>), 
    specifically the <a href="#bib-smpte-standards-operation-manual-v31"></a> and the Intellectual Property Policy 
    included therein.
  • That all references to governance and policy documents refer to the version current at 
    the time of my participation as a guest
  • That I may be participating in issues relating to the ongoing appraisal of technologies,
    and in decisions that are interim by nature and may undergo substantial revisions. I
    recognize that SMPTE encourages me to discuss such issues privately with others
    considered to be knowledgeable in the field. However, since premature public disclosure 
    may be a disservice to the industry I agree to refrain from either directly or
    indirectly making any public disclosure of the business transacted by the Committee
    without the express consent of the Committee Chair and the Standards Vice President.
  • That recording of meetings (except by the Secretary as permitted by the 
    <a href="#bib-smpte-standards-operation-manual-v31"></a>) is prohibited and if, when available, I 
    choose to attend meetings by electronic means, this same prohibition applies.
  • That these obligations continue indefinitely, and do not terminate when I cease to
    participate as a guest.

I have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the above terms and conditions, including
without limitation those included in the <a href="#bib-smpte-standards-operation-manual-v31"></a> and Intellectual 
Property Policy.
